</span></p>

<p>I watch some videos from YouTube:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF4584aa9eg">Japanese Grammar : Lesson 1 ( Sentence Structure )</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8111YRrCOyU&amp;t=265s">Japanese Vocabulary | Animals</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And I learned Japanese grammar from this website <a href="https://www.verbalplanet.com/learn-japanese/blog/basics-of-japanese-grammar.asp"><u>Essential Japanese Grammar: A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners</u>
</a>, and I made some useful notes listed below:</p>
<h2 id="fundamental-japanese-grammar-concepts">Fundamental Japanese Grammar Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="sentence-structure">Sentence Structure</h3>
<p>The basic sentence structure in Japanese follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order, which is a departure from the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order commonly found in English. In Japanese, the verb always comes at the end of the sentence. For example, the English sentence “I eat sushi” translates to “私は寿司を食べます (Watashi wa sushi o tabemasu)” in Japanese, where “私 (Watashi)” is the subject, “寿司 (sushi)” is the object, and “食べます (tabemasu)” is the verb.</p>

<h3 id="particles">Particles</h3>
<p>Particles are short words used to indicate the roles of words within a sentence, such as the subject, object, or context of an action. They are akin to prepositions or conjunctions in English but are used more extensively in Japanese to provide clarity and nuance. Some of the most common particles include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>は (wa): Indicates the topic of the sentence, often translated as “as for” or “speaking of.”</li>
  <li>が (ga): Marks the subject of the sentence, especially to introduce new information or emphasize the subject.</li>
  <li>を (o/wo): Marks the direct object of a verb.</li>
  <li>に (ni): Indicates direction, destination, point in time, or indirect object.</li>
  <li>で (de): Indicates the location where an action takes place or means by which an action is performed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding how to use particles correctly is essential for conveying meaning accurately in Japanese.</p>

<details class="gpt4o">
<summary>More Examples</summary>
<p>Japanese particles are essential elements in the language, used to indicate the grammatical function of words in a sentence. Here are some commonly used particles and their functions, along with examples:  </p>
<p><strong>は (wa)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Usage: Topic marker</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>日本語は面白いです。
Nihongo wa omoshiroi desu.
&quot;Japanese is interesting.&quot;  </li>

<h3 id="politeness-and-formality">Politeness and Formality</h3>
<p>Japanese places a significant emphasis on politeness and formality, which is reflected in its grammar. The language features different levels of politeness, primarily expressed through verb forms and specific vocabulary. The plain form (辞書形, jisho-kei) is used among friends, family, or in informal settings, while the polite form (丁寧形, teinei-kei) is used in more formal or public situations. Recognizing and appropriately using these forms is crucial for respectful and effective communication in Japanese.</p>

<h2 id="japanese-verb-conjugations">Japanese Verb Conjugations</h2>
<p>Verb conjugations are a fundamental aspect of Japanese grammar, affecting the meaning and politeness level of sentences. Japanese verbs are categorized into three groups based on their conjugation patterns: Group 1 (う-verbs), Group 2 (る-verbs), and Group 3 (irregular verbs). Understanding these conjugation rules is crucial for forming correct sentences in both spoken and written Japanese.</p>

<h3 id="group-1-う-verbs-u-verbs">Group 1: う-verbs (U-verbs)</h3>
<p>Group 1 verbs, also known as う-verbs or godan verbs, have various endings in their dictionary form, but all can be modified in a pattern that involves changing the final vowel sound. For beginners, recognizing and applying the conjugation rules for う-verbs is vital, as they are numerous and frequently used in daily conversation. For example, the verb “to write” is “書く (kaku)” in its dictionary form. To convert it to the polite present tense, you change the ending to “きます (kimasu),” resulting in “書きます (kakimasu).”</p>

<h3 id="group-2-る-verbs-ru-verbs">Group 2: る-verbs (Ru-verbs)</h3>
<p>Group 2 verbs, or る-verbs, end in “る” in their dictionary form and are also known as ichidan verbs. These verbs have a simpler conjugation pattern compared to う-verbs. To conjugate a る-verb into the polite present tense, you simply replace “る” with “ります.” For instance, “to eat,” which is “食べる (taberu)” in its dictionary form, becomes “食べます (tabemasu)” in the polite present tense.</p>

<h3 id="group-3-irregular-verbs">Group 3: Irregular Verbs</h3>
<p>There are only a few irregular verbs in Japanese, but they are very common and essential to learn. The two most important irregular verbs are “to do” (する, suru) and “to come” (来る, kuru). These verbs do not follow the regular conjugation patterns of Group 1 or Group 2 verbs and must be memorized. For example, “する (suru)” becomes “します (shimasu)” in the polite present tense, and “来る (kuru)” becomes “来ます (kimasu).”</p>

<h3 id="verb-forms">Verb Forms</h3>
<p>Japanese verbs can express various tenses and aspects, including present, past, negative, and past negative. The verb form changes not only to indicate time but also to reflect the level of politeness. Here are the basic rules for these conjugations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plain Form: The dictionary form of the verb, used among friends or in informal settings.</li>
  <li>Polite Form: Created by modifying the verb stem and adding “ます” (masu) at the end, used in formal or polite contexts.</li>
  <li>Negative Form: To negate a verb, the ending is changed in a pattern specific to its group. For う-verbs, “う” changes to “わない” in the plain negative form. For る-verbs, “る” is replaced with “ない.”</li>
  <li>Past Form: The past tense is indicated by changing the end of the verb. For う-verbs in the plain past form, “う” changes to “った.” For る-verbs, “る” is replaced with “た.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="japanese-nouns-and-pronouns">Japanese Nouns and Pronouns</h2>
<p>In Japanese, nouns and pronouns play a critical role in constructing meaningful sentences. Unlike verbs, nouns in Japanese do not conjugate, making them relatively straightforward to use. However, understanding their proper application, especially in conjunction with particles, is essential for accurate communication. Pronouns in Japanese, while used less frequently than in some languages like English, are crucial for referring to people, places, and things without repeating nouns.</p>

<h3 id="nouns">Nouns</h3>
<p>Nouns in Japanese represent people, places, things, or ideas, and they do not change form based on number or gender. This means the same noun can refer to one item or several items, with context often clarifying the intended meaning. For example, “本 (hon)” can mean “book” or “books,” depending on the sentence in which it is used. Japanese nouns can be used with particles to indicate their role in a sentence, such as the subject, object, or location.</p>

<details class="gpt4o">
<summary>More Examples</summary>
<p>Sure! Here are more examples of Japanese nouns:</p>
<ol>
<li>人 (hito) - person/people</li>
<li>猫 (neko) - cat/cats</li>
<li>山 (yama) - mountain/mountains</li>
<li>車 (kuruma) - car/cars</li>
<li>学校 (gakkou) - school/schools   </li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these nouns can be used with particles to indicate their grammatical role:</p>
<ul>
<li>が (ga) for the subject:<ul>
<li>猫がいる (Neko ga iru) - There is a cat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>を (wo) for the object:<ul>
<li>本を読む (Hon wo yomu) - Read a book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>で (de) for the location of an action:<ul>
<li>学校で勉強する (Gakkou de benkyou suru) - Study at school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>に (ni) for the destination or time:<ul>
<li>山に行く (Yama ni iku) - Go to the mountain.</li>
<li>3時に会う (Sanji ni au) - Meet at 3 o&#39;clock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>の (no) for possession or description:<ul>
<li>車の色 (Kuruma no iro) - The color of the car.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


</details>

<h3 id="pronouns">Pronouns</h3>
<p>Japanese pronouns are used to refer to people or things without naming them directly. Pronouns can be categorized into personal pronouns (I, you, he, she, we, they) and demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those). Personal pronouns in Japanese vary widely based on the speaker’s gender, the relationship between the speaker and the listener, and the level of formality. For example, “私 (watashi)” is a commonly used pronoun for “I” or “me,” which is considered relatively formal and gender-neutral. Demonstrative pronouns, such as “これ (kore)” for “this,” “それ (sore)” for “that,” “あれ (are)” for “that over there,” and “これら (korera)” for “these,” are used to point to objects or people in relation to the speaker’s and listener’s physical or conversational context.</p>

<details class="gpt4o">

<h3 id="usage-of-nouns-and-pronouns">Usage of Nouns and Pronouns</h3>
<ul>
  <li>With Particles: Nouns and pronouns are often used with particles to specify their grammatical function. For instance, “私は (watashi wa)” means “I (am/subject marker),” and “本を (hon o)” means “book(s) (object marker).”</li>
  <li>Possession: To indicate possession, the particle “の (no)” is used. For example, “私の本 (watashi no hon)” translates to “my book.”</li>
  <li>Counting Objects: When counting objects, specific counters are used with numbers, which can change based on the shape or nature of the object being counted. For example, “本 (hon)” is also a counter for long, cylindrical objects, so “三本のペン (san-bon no pen)” means “three pens.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="adjectives-and-adverbs">Adjectives and Adverbs</h2>
<p>Adjectives and adverbs are indispensable parts of speech in Japanese, adding description and detail to nouns and verbs, respectively. Japanese adjectives are unique in that they conjugate to reflect tense and negation, much like verbs. Adverbs, on the other hand, modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs to provide more information about the action or state described. This section will explore the usage of adjectives and adverbs, including their forms and functions.</p>

<h3 id="adjectives">Adjectives</h3>
<p>In Japanese, there are two main types of adjectives: <strong>い-adjectives (i-adjectives)</strong> and <strong>な-adjectives (na-adjectives)</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>い-Adjectives</strong>: These adjectives end with the hiragana character い (i) in their dictionary form. To modify a noun, you simply place the い-adjective before the noun. For example, “高い山 (takai yama)” means “a high mountain.” To conjugate these adjectives into the past tense or negative forms, you adjust the ending. For instance, “高かった (takakatta)” means “was high,” and “高くない (takakunai)” means “is not high.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>な-Adjectives</strong>: These adjectives require the particle な (na) when directly modifying a noun. For example, “静かな部屋 (shizuka na heya)” means “a quiet room.” Unlike い-adjectives, な-adjectives do not change form when they modify nouns. To express the past tense or negation, adjustments are typically made in a sentence’s verb or through the use of adjectival nouns.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adverbs">Adverbs</h3>
<p>Adverbs in Japanese often come from the transformation of adjectives or are inherently adverbial phrases. To convert an い-adjective into an adverb, replace the final い (i) with く (ku). For example, “高く (takaku)” means “highly” or “at a high level.” な-adjectives become adverbs by adding に (ni) to the end. For instance, “静かに (shizuka ni)” means “quietly.”</p>

<p>Adverbs can modify verbs, adjectives, and even other adverbs, providing information such as how, when, where, and to what extent an action is performed or a state exists. For example, “ゆっくりと歩く (yukkuri to aruku)” means “to walk slowly.”</p>

<h3 id="usage-in-sentences">Usage in Sentences</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Describing Nouns</strong>: Place adjectives directly before the nouns they modify. For example, “新しい車 (atarashii kuruma)” means “a new car.”</li>
  <li><strong>Creating Adverbial Phrases</strong>: Use adverbs to modify verbs or adjectives, typically placing them directly before the word they modify. For example, “急いで行く (isoide iku)” means “to go quickly.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="forming-questions">Forming Questions</h2>
<p>The ability to ask questions is a fundamental aspect of communication in any language. In Japanese, forming questions involves specific grammatical structures and particles that distinguish a statement from a question. This section will guide you through the basics of forming questions in Japanese, focusing on the use of the question particle か (ka) and the construction of “wh-“ questions.</p>

<h3 id="the-question-particle-か-ka">The Question Particle か (Ka)</h3>
<p>To convert a statement into a question in Japanese, you can simply add the particle か (ka) at the end of the sentence. This particle functions similarly to the English question mark, indicating that the sentence is a question. For example, the statement “これは本です (kore wa hon desu)” means “This is a book.” By adding か, it becomes “これは本ですか (kore wa hon desu ka)?” translating to “Is this a book?”</p>

<h3 id="wh--questions">“Wh-“ Questions</h3>
<p>“Wh-“ questions in Japanese involve interrogative words that start with “wh-“ in English, such as who, what, where, when, and why. These words are placed at the beginning of the sentence in English, but in Japanese, they can appear in the position relevant to what they are asking about, often followed by the particle か (ka) to mark the sentence as a question.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who: 誰 (dare) - “誰が来ましたか (Dare ga kimashita ka)?” means “Who came?”</li>
  <li>What: 何 (nani) - “何を食べますか (Nani o tabemasu ka)?” means “What will you eat?”</li>
  <li>Where: どこ (doko) - “どこで会いましょうか (Doko de aimashou ka)?” means “Where shall we meet?”</li>
  <li>When: いつ (itsu) - “いつ出発しますか (Itsu shuppatsu shimasu ka)?” means “When do we depart?”</li>
  <li>Why: なぜ (naze) or どうして (doushite) - “なぜ遅れましたか (Naze okuremashita ka)?” means “Why were you late?”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="formulating-questions-without-か-ka">Formulating Questions Without か (Ka)</h3>
<p>In informal or conversational Japanese, it’s common to form questions without using the particle か (ka), especially among friends or in less formal contexts. The intonation at the end of the sentence rises, similar to how a question’s intonation rises in English. For example, “これは本です (kore wa hon desu)?” with a rising intonation can also imply “Is this a book?” in a casual setting.</p>

<h2 id="useful-expressions-and-politeness-levels">Useful Expressions and Politeness Levels</h2>
<p>Communication in Japanese is heavily influenced by the cultural importance placed on respect and social hierarchy. This is reflected in the language through various expressions of politeness and the use of honorifics. Understanding these nuances is crucial for anyone learning Japanese, as they affect not only how one speaks but also how one is perceived by others. This section covers some useful expressions and the basics of politeness levels in Japanese.</p>

<h3 id="useful-expressions">Useful Expressions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Greetings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>おはようございます (Ohayou gozaimasu) - “Good morning” (polite).</li>

<h3 id="politeness-levels">Politeness Levels</h3>
<p>Japanese language features various levels of politeness, primarily determined by verb forms and certain prefixes or suffixes added to nouns. The three main levels of politeness are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plain Form (辞書形, Jisho-kei)</strong>: Also known as the dictionary form, used with friends, family, or in informal settings. It’s the base form of verbs without additional politeness markers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Polite Form (丁寧形, Teinei-kei)</strong>: Characterized by the addition of “ます (masu)” to the verb stem, used in everyday polite speech. This form is appropriate in most situations where respect is due, such as speaking with strangers, teachers, or in professional settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Honorific and Humble Forms (敬語, Keigo)</strong>: Includes sonkeigo (respectful language), kenjougo (humble language), and teineigo (polite language). These forms are used to show respect towards the listener or someone you’re talking about. For example, “お + verb stem + になる (o + verb stem + ni naru)” is an honorific verb form, and “お + noun + さま (o + noun + sama)” is a respectful way to refer to someone else’s possessions or family members.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
